# Password-Generator
Random password based on user-selected criteria.

<p> This application will generate a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

<p> The user will be prompted to choose from the following password criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>Length (must be between 8 and 128 characters)</li> </ul>

<ul>
<li>Character type:</li>


<li>Special characters (see examples)</li>


<li>Numeric characters</li>


<li>Lowercase characters</li>


<li>Uppercase characters</li> </ul>



<p>The application should validate user input and ensure that at least one character type is selected.
Once all prompts are answered, the user will be presented with a password matching the answered prompts. Displaying the generated password in an alert is acceptable, but attempt to write the password to the page instead.<br>

Also, the user should also have the option to click a button to copy the password to their clipboard. </p>
